// MARK: - FPCClient

/// An FPC client that connects to SEQPACKET servers.
///
/// This client establishes a connection-oriented, message-boundary-preserving
/// Unix-domain socket connection and returns an ``FPCEndpoint`` for communication.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```swift
/// let endpoint = try FPCClient.connect(path: "/tmp/fpc.sock")
/// await endpoint.start()
/// try await endpoint.send(message)
/// ```
public struct FPCClient {

    /// Connects to a SEQPACKET FPC server.
    ///
    /// Creates a Unix-domain SEQPACKET socket, connects to the server at the given
    /// path, and returns an ``FPCEndpoint`` wrapping the connected socket.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - path: The filesystem path of the server's socket
    ///   - ioQueue: Optional custom DispatchQueue for I/O operations. If `nil`, a default queue is created.
    /// - Returns: A new, unstarted ``FPCEndpoint``. Call ``start()`` before use.
    /// - Throws: A system error if the socket cannot be created or the connection is refused

    /// a directory descriptor. This is useful in Capsicum sandboxes where you
    /// have a capability for the directory but cannot use absolute paths.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - directory: A directory descriptor to use as the base for the path.
    ///   - path: The relative path to the server's socket within the directory.
    ///   - ioQueue: Optional custom DispatchQueue for I/O operations. If `nil`, a default queue is created.
    /// - Returns: A new, unstarted ``FPCEndpoint``. Call ``start()`` before use.
